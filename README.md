# code for Stegner MA & Spanbauer TL, North American pollen records provide macro-scale ecological evidence for the Anthropocene

# to run this code, you will first need to:

# 1) generate the Bayesian age models using code from
# Wang et al. (2019) Bayesian ages for pollen records since the last glaciation. Sci Data 6, 176
# Available at https://github.com/yuewangpaleo/BaconAgeNeotoma
# NOTE: some components of the BaconAgeNeotoma code is depreciated due to the update of the 'neotoma' package to 'neotoma2'
# in particular, the posteriorout.csv files and depths.txt files for each site are used here


# 2) for regional analysis, download the EPA Level I Ecoregions of North America shapefile
